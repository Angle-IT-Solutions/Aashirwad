            <p>Refractive Surgery(LASIK, Femtosecond, Zyoptics)  <br>
                We provide complete pre-operative assessment and workup for refractive surgery (LASIK), operative guidance and post-operative management to get rid of glasses

                  <p>This procedure can be performed on the patients having very high myopia or hypermetropia with the parameters in his or her eyes which cannot be corrected by lasik procedure or ICL implantation. It is indicated where Lasik laser procedure and ICL implantation are not possible. The procedure is just like simple cataract surgery of the patient's eye by Phaco method and replacing the natural lens of the eye by intraocular lens of the same power by which the dependence of the patient on high spectacle power is gone. We can correct the range of numbers from -2Dsph to -20Dsph and +1Dsph to +10Dsph.</p>
                  <p>The procedure is of 15 mins in each eye. There is no injection given for this procedure. It is painless. There is no patch or dressing applied recovery time is 1 or 2 days. It eliminates patient's dependence on distant glasses. Patient has to wear reading glasses if he/she has undergone monofocal lens implantation. It is a very cheap and nice surgery and should be performed on young patients who are not eligible for Lasik or ICL implantation</p>
                  
                  <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE) For The Over 40s</h4>
                  <p>This treatment is more suitable for patients over the age 40, for the patient who doesn't want to wear distant as well as near vision glasses (presbyopic) and is the same as cataract surgery. The natural lens of the eye is replaced with an artificial lens of the correct power to correct the vision. The recovery and rehabiltation of the patient is very fast and patient can resume his/her work within 3-4 days. It also avoids the future need for cataract surgery which comes to all of us if we live long enough. A big advantage is that multi-focal lenses (if used) can correct both distant as well as near vision, avoiding the need for reading glasses.
                    <br> In very high prescriptions, it is not always possible to get near to zero in one step. Fine-tuning of the result is sometimes needed with laser treatment by BIOPTICS.
                    <br> Cure Sight Laser Centre conducts refractive lens exchange for young and middle aged people with very high rate of success and patient satisfaction.
                    <br> Cure Sight Laser Centre is determined to bring tomorrow's technology today marching ahead with the time. We at CSLC are able to give best refractive outcome to our patients by hard work, humble approach, using the experience as well as the skill of the doctors and the staff at most affordable rates.

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">What Is Lasik?</h4> 
                    <p>Laser Assisted in sltu keratomileusis or Lasik, is most performed refractive surgery in the world.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Lasik the eye surgeon uses a microsurgical instrument called Microkeratome / Femtosecond Laser FS 200 (Bladeless) to create the corneal flap and Excimer Laser (EX 500 world's fastest Laser) to reshape the cornea according to patients refractive error in such a way that the rays are focused on the retina automatically without the help of glasses or contact lenses.                            
                        </li>
                        <li>More than 5-6 million eyes are operated every year by Lasik Laser worldwide.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is the safest method in which there is no pain, no injection, on dressing and the procedure is of few seconds only.</li>
                        <li>Patient can resume his/her work from the very next day.</li>
                        <li>Lasik is an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat myopia (Near Sightedness), hyperopia (far sightedness) and astigmatism.</li>
                        <li>Lasik eliminates your dependence on glasses and contact lenses.</li>
                        <li>Almost every patient achieves near normal vision after Lasik Laser procedure.</li>
                        <li>Patient can read, Write, Work on Computer, Travel, Cook, Watch T.V., go for Movie, Drive is/her vehicle and take shower or head bath within 2 days.</li>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">What Is Blade-Free Opti LASIK ?</h4>
                    <p>(Femto-LASIK) (All Laser Lasik, Blade Less Lasik, Intra Lasik)</p>
                    <p>Femto-LASIK is a 'blade free procedure' where only laser systems are used to cut the flap . It is thus a more precise, Predictable and safe method for creating the corneal flap as compared to the conventional microkeratome ('blade') flaps. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the increased safety during surgery, Femtosecond-Opti LASIK flaps have vertical edges which ensure quicker and stronger healing as compared to microkeratome flaps which have sloping edges. </p>
                    <p>This translates into a much less risk of displacement of the flaps in case of inadvertent injury to the eye. Quality of vision (i.e. crispness, contrast etc.) is also superior with Femtosecond-Opti LASIK because of the uniformly thick flaps and the smooth corneal bed.</p>
                    <p>The femtosecond laser is used for the initial part of the LASIK surgery when the corneal flap is prepared. The surgeon then switches to an excimer laser to achieve the cornel ablation and correct the visual disorder.</p>
                    <p>A special contact glass PI (Cone) is placed on the eye for the laser pulses to pass through and focus into cornea.</p>
                    <p>The Surgeon uses a microscope to follow the progress of flap creation. After the cut is completed, the PI (cone) is removed. Using a fine instrument, the flap is folded back exposing the stromal bed of the cornea.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the excimer laser is used for the corneal ablation to correct the near-sightedness, farsightedness/or astigmatism. When the ablation is completed, the flap is folded back and it adheres tightly to the stromal bed.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">Implantable Collamer Lens Surgery ( ICL)</h4>                    
                    <p>Lasik eye surgery today is a safe and effective method of correcting near sightedness, far sightedness and astigmatism for the vast majority of patients seeking laser vision correction of their refractive error. However, for some patients who have very high plus or minus numbers and very thin corneas or have other corneal conditions that might lead to complications with Lasik Laser procedure, another alternative is ICL to correct their numbers of the eyes.</p>
                    <p>ICL implantation is one of the most accepted procedure in the world for the correction of refractive error of the patient's eye. We can correct the numbers ranging from -1D to -20D and +1D to +10D and ±1Cyl to ±6Cyl. By very short procedure of 15 mins in each eye. It is done by placing ICL lens in front of the crystalline lens of the eye and behind the iris. The Modern day ICL doesn't give any side effect like glaucoma. This procedure is of 15-20 mins in which there is no injection given to patients eye to create the numbness in the eye, no suture taken, no pain occurs there is no redness in the eye post operatively and we don't apply any patch or dressing on the patients eye. It is walk in walk out procedure. The main advantage of ICL lens implantation is that we can correct huge range of numbers up to 30D. It is a very safe. The patient doesn't face any problem of night glare or dry eyes in his/her eye.</p>
                    <p>In ICL implantation procedure the lens is readily implanted in your eye behind the iris of the eye, by gently folding it and injecting it into the anterior chamber through a tiny incision of 3.0mm in length placed by the eye surgeon at the clear edge of cornea. Patient can go home immediately with clear vision after ICL implantation. We can correct number above -20D or +10D with ICL implantation. The ICL was approved by US FDA in December 2005. We are performing ICL implantation regularly at our center with great success.</p>
                    <p>We are pioneer of ICL lens implantation in Gujarat. Till date we have done one of the highest ICL lens implantation in the country.</p>
                    <p>7 days after ICL implantation patient can do all the activities like reading, writing, computer work, cooking, driving, taking shower, etc. 1 month after ICL implantation the patient can play all outdoor games like cricket, football, hockey, swimming etc. It is very useful for Job and Marriage purpose.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">WHAT IS AN IMPLANTABLE COLLAMER LENS (ICL)?</h4> 
                    <p><strong>The Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) </strong> is an advanced, thin, clear lens that functions similarly to a contact lens, however it is surgically implanted into the eye. The ICL cannot be felt while in the eye, requires no maintenance and can be removed if needed. The ICL does not replace your natural lens, but is implanted in front of your natural lens and behind your iris (the coloured part of the eye).</p>
                        <p>The ICL procedure is a low risk, long-term solution and, as such, is a good option for many patients, especially those under the age of 40. The procedure is often recommended for patients with high prescriptions for either short-sightedness (myopia) or long-sightedness (hyperopia), because often the cornea is not thick enough to be treated safely with laser eye surgery procedures such as LASIK.</p>
                        <p>The procedure is a permanent one – or until you decide that you may want to remove it.  The ICL has the advantage of being reversible.</p>
                        <p>The ICL is specifically manufactured to correct your prescription and its strength is determined after a thorough series of measurements at our clinic.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF ICL?</h4> 
                        <p>The key benefits of ICL include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a low-risk and permanent solution.</li>
                            <li>The lens cannot be felt while in the eye</li>
                            <li>No maintenance is required</li>
                            <li>The lens can be removed if required – reversible procedure</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">WHAT IS THE ICL MADE OF?</h4> 
                    <p>The Visian ICL is made from a material called Collamer, a collagen co-polymer that contains a small amount of purified collagen.  It is stable and biocompatible and has been used for many years in the lenses implanted during cataract surgery. and ICL.  The lens also contains an ultraviolet (UV) filter.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">WHAT IS THE ICL MADE OF?</h4> 
                    <p>There are a few things to remember prior to your surgery:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not wear soft contact lenses for 7 days prior to your surgery (or as advised).</li>
                        <li>Do not wear any make up or fragrances on the day or surgery.</li>
                        <li>Take any prescribed medications as usual unless advised by Dr Wolfe.</li>
                        <li>You will need to fast at least 5 hours prior to your procedure. However, if you have other conditions such as diabetes, Dr Wolfe will discuss your specific fasting requirements with you.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">HOW DOES ICL SURGERY WORK?</h4>
                    <p>Your ICL procedure will performed at a Day Procedure Centre.  After you have been admitted, you will meet with your anaesthetist who will discuss aspects of your general health and the procedure with you.</p>
                    <p>You will be given sedation to make you relaxed during the procedure and the anaesthetist will ensure you are comfortable throughout.</p>
                    <p>Anaesthetic eye drops are used to numb the eye and Dr Wolfe will place a small instrument between your eyelids to prevent blinking.  You may notice some bright lights from the microscope but you will not see the procedure as it happens.</p>
                    <p>The customised lens is folded into a special injector and Dr Wolfe will make a small opening through which he will insert the ICL.  Once inside the eye, the ICL will unfold and be positioned.  The opening then seals on its own; usually without the need for stitches.</p>
                    <p>You only spend 20 to 30 minutes in the theatre but will be at the Day Procedure Centre for 2-3 hours.  You will need to have someone collect you and stay with you at home afterwards while you recover.</p>
                    <p>Usually the eyes are treated a minimum of one week apart.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER ICL SURGERY?</h4>
                    <p>You will need to arrange for someone to take you home and to stay with you at home after the procedure. You should plan to avoid strenuous activity for 48 hours.</p>
                    <p>Until all the drops wear off, your vision may be blurry, however, most patients see well the next day.  You vision will likely fluctuate as the eyes heal then settle over the first few weeks following ICL surgery.  There may be some mild discomfort or a gritty sensation for a few days after the procedure.</p>
                    <p>After ICL surgery, Dr Wolfe will prescribe antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops to take for a few weeks.  The majority of patients can resume normal activities within a week of their ICL surgery, however, we ask that you do not drive until you have been advised that it is safe to do so.</p>
                    <p>Dr Wolfe will see you back at VISTAeyes for reviews over several months following your procedure as necessary.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">AM I A SUITABLE CANDIDATE FOR ICL?</h4>
                    <p>ICL surgery may be suitable for patients who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Currently wear uncomfortable or heavy glasses</li>
                        <li>Struggle with wearing contact lenses</li>
                        <li>Are unsuitable for laser eye surgery such as LASIK or ASLA</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The ICL procedure is used to treat short-sightedness (myopia), long-sightedness (hyperopia) and astigmatism. If you are over the age of 18 years, have stable vision and healthy eyes then ICL surgery could be the right solution for you.</p>
                    <p>The ideal ICL candidate has not had any ophthalmic surgery and does not have a history of eye disease such as iritis, glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5" style="color: #2c4964; font-weight: 600;">WHAT ARE THE RISKS WITH ICL SURGERY?</h4>
                    <p>The risks are rare and often only minor if they occur. ICL surgery is a safe procedure, but like all surgical or medical procedures there is always a risk of complication. All known complications will be discussed at your consultation.</p>
